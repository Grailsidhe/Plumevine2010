### A blast from the past! 2010
Back in the hay day I self-taught HTML, CSS and how to adapt Javascript from online resources. I already
had several years playing with Photoshop and as a creative, this allowed me to create websites for my online
jewellery business "Plumevine".

These sites were very image-heavy as I liked using my own photos in a magazine cover style with seamless browsing using an iframe.
The photos would be cut into pieces and put together with tables. It really was another era in HTML. I coded in Notepad by hand and
used inline styling. Smartphones were also not a thing so the site isn't responsive.

### Today
It's been a while since 2010 and today (July 2021) I'm doing a Full stack Web Developer bootcamp at [Wild Code School](http://wildcodeschool.com)
to update and improve my skills. Now I can understand Javascript, play with CSS, make better HTML and lighter sites that are still fun, all
the while getting into React and whatever else the bootcamp has in store for me.

#### Tools used:
- Photoshop
- Notepad
