<br><br>

In a galaxy far far far away, in a planet named Gaie the Gaiens went about their daily lives as usual.

<br><br>
Generally Gaiens were oblivious to their close connection to the Mist Realm, one would say, the soul of Gaie and each Gaien, interlaced with their physical selves.

<br><br>
The Mist realm watched and worked hard at keeping Gaie in balance by using influence and showering Gaie with as much love as they could. Inspiration was their greatest tool and it was used very strongly, but the Gaiens had lost their connection to the Mist Realm, at least their awareness of it as they could not be separated, being fundamental aspects of one another, and deep down they went about their lives with a deep feeling of having lost something but not really knowing what.

<br><br>
The wisdom of the ages was also forgotten by Gaiens through time, but the Mist Realm kept it close, with their influence, their inspiration and their love, they sought to bring it back.

<br><br>
On this one day, at this one moment, and for no reason known to anyone but the Cosmos itself, the Cosmos was to grant Gaiens a gift: it would allow the Mist Realm to simply and freely give Gaiens a token of their wisdom of the ages. The Cosmos sang that a special time was upon all, and that it was time Gaiens remembered something forgotten.

<br><br>
So on this one day, at this one particular moment, a messenger from the Mist Realm prepared to impart this great wisdom.

<br><br>
Light Spheres or Globes were no mystery in the Mist Realm, they knew well that these held the magic of worlds, and that everyone had the power to create them. They knew that in every water drop lie celestial bodies as they did in the outer space, and all throughout the cosmos. They knew that light was the spark that brought life into them, and they treasured these Light Spheres with much reverence and love.

<br><br>
Gaie, was a light sphere also, as was the heart of every Gaien.

<br><br>
Then one night, the messenger from the Mist Realm in one special dream appeared to all the Gaiens. Her appearance could not be entirely agreed upon, because she had the face of every Gaien who saw her exclusively. This marvellous dream not all would remember upon waking, but it would lay imprinted in their hearts so they would know, even if they didn't remember.

<br><br>
That night every Gaien saw this image and in their minds heard: <i>"Worlds within worlds.."</i>

<br><br>
<span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-size: small;">That morning every Gaien felt a little different, some remembered what they had seen, others didn't, but nonetheless, they all felt a deep love and reverence for all that lived, knowing therein lie their very selves.&nbsp;</span></span>

<br><br>
And therein lies the story of the Celestial Origins, as this Gaien told me using influence and inspiration, the story of worlds within worlds, which through influence and inspiration I hope to spread to other Earthlings with these pieces containing light spheres, by sharing this story and wondering how many times it has been told, and in how many places..
